# Python_bootcamp
This is my first Bootcamp on python I chose python to get my first contact with the coding world  ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥³.

Also, I will create my phyton portfolio here. So I will be updating my codes and projects about python in the future. Also, it will give me the confidence to participate in the collaboration of python code. And is a good way to lear Git at the same time.

So,  be free to give me a comment or advice if you see one of my codes can be improved.

Finally I updated my GitHub.
